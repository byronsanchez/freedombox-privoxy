This is a (lightly) modified Privoxy and a set of config for it that
prefers SSL and tries to limit privacy tracking as you use the web.  It
is geared toward the FreedomBox environment.  In particular, it
listens on all interfaces and assumes you are protecting yourself via
iptables or some upstream firewall.
